This app is written using HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL and JavaScript with its own database.
User can register using his e-mail, then he gets special generated token, thanks to that he can activate his account, after this, he can log in.
In this application user can add his expenses and incomes.
He can see his balance from last month or chosen period.
User can also edit his profile and reset his password in case he forgets it.
I used AJAX technology to asynchronously get data from server without reloading a page.
